            <p class="hobtext">This are all my personal opinion. Although, all of the games here may seem somewhat weird. It all gave me a life-changing experience. Some of the recommendation level are slightly low because its usually requires you to have to play with friend to make it better. But truth to be told, every game with friends would definitely be better than being alone.</p>
            <p class="hobtext">The reason as to why I rated 3 for party animals is that without friends this game is not as fun as it was suppose to be. Its common sense, but for me personally, I think its not easy to play a game like this for a long period of time. It gets boring after a while unlike souls-like game.</p>
            <p class="hobtext">I personally enjoy FromSoft games as their lore is very interesting, their gameplay requires skill unlike some other games which are p2w and it ruins the fun for f2p players like me. Moreover, their environment and visual graphics is extremely eye-appealing and eye-catching. It makes it feel like you're in a dream world which is something I like. Their character creation page is also one of the things I find fun with. I am able create a character I want and use them to defeat bosses which I find it quite fun.</p>
